# 3160 Database Project

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to extend the CraveOnCampus database by adding a driver and resturant rating system. This project extends the database that was designed by a previous team in the ITSC3160 course, only the rating system is original work. The rating system additions include a use case diagram, business rules, ERD, and data dictionary. The changes will be documented in this GitHub readme.
